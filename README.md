# Task-Zoo
All of the code and scenes from my app in development


If something happens and you need to extract these files to make them run, dont forget to put all of the prefab files in a folder labeled resources that way the code doesn't mess up when instantiating them.

File Heirarchy:

Assets:
      Resources:
          All the .prefab files
      Everything else(all the .unity and .cs files)
